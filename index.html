    <h1>Hello world!</h1>

    <p>This is BurrowHost,</p>

    <p>
      A service that will host your Minecraft server and manage it for you.
      Want a new game? A new set of rules to play by? Just ask and we can find you all the right mods,
      plugins, resource packs you want!
    </p>

    <p>
      If you want to help us test our service, you will get a month of a server
      paid for and managed by us, as long as you are okay giving us feedback
      on what you would want to pay for and what you think we can do better!
    </p>
