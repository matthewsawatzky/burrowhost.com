        <h2>Why we started BurrowHost.</h2>
        <p class="muted">A quick look at who we are and why we manage Minecraft servers.</p>
      </div>
      <ul class="plan__features">
        <li>We started hosting Minecraft servers because, for years, playing together wasn’t as simple as it should have been. When we were younger, we didn’t have the technical skills to manage servers, so we learned over time—studying computer science and IT, experimenting with plugins and modpacks, and running small servers for friends and family. As we gained experience, server management became a normal part of how we played, and we noticed the same problems repeatedly appearing for players trying to set up their own servers.</li>
        <br>
        <li>In 2025, we decided to turn what we had learned into a service built around how real players use Minecraft. We’re a two-person team: one of us handles hosting, optimization, mod installation, and backend systems; the other focuses on gameplay, testing modpacks, world layouts, and overall player experience. Instead of maintaining our own hardware, we run servers through reliable data centers so we can focus on configuration, management, and support.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Our goal is simple: handle the technical work so players can focus on playing. We manage setup, mods, maintenance, and updates, and we address any changes players need. This project began as a small effort between two brothers who have spent most of their lives playing Minecraft and repairing broken setups, and we continue refining the service as we go.</li>
